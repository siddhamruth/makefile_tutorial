les ssee some implicit rules here:

c code compilation

object files are generated from .c and .h files

test1.c --> test1.o

CC = gcc #flag for implecit rules
CFLAGS = -g #flag for implicit rules to turn on debug info

test1 is executable and i want it

test1.o is converted to test1 by linker by implicit rules
tesst1.c is converted to test1.o is converted by compiler by implicit rules
