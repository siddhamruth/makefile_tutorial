this is a practice session of my make file learning journey.

the plan is to explore each topic in https://makefiletutorial.com/#getting-started in little more detail and divide the webpage into sub programs

I work in c hence i concentrate mostly on hoe the program structure must be in c and how to maintain it.

this is the first work starting today 10/05/2023. 

i have created each folder with a readme file and u can read and compile the program.
